## ðŸ“¦ Technologies & Tools Covered

- **Node.js** â€“ Core modules, non-blocking architecture, event loop
- **Express.js** â€“ Routing, middleware, and REST API development
- **MongoDB & Mongoose** â€“ NoSQL data modeling and interactions
- **Pug** â€“ Templating engine for server-rendered web pages
- **JWT** â€“ Authentication and authorization workflows
- **Stripe** â€“ Integration for payment processing
- **SendGrid / Mailtrap** â€“ Email functionality
- **Heroku** â€“ Deployment platform
- **Git & GitHub** â€“ Version control and collaboration
